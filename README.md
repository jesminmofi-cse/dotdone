##Dot Done## is a simple to-do list app with adding, storing, and deleting the tasks.
This app helps with us in the productivity and have an organised routine.
Sleek. Snappy. Symbolic. That little “dot” isn’t just a design choice — it’s a ritual of closure. Every time you check a task, it’s like whispering to chaos: Not today.
